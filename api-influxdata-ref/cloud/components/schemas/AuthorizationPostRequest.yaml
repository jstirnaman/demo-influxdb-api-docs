          An organization ID.
          Specifies the organization that owns the authorization.

      permissions:
        description: |
          A list of permissions for an authorization.
          In the list, provide at least one `permission` object.

          In a `permission`, the `resource.type` property grants access to all
          resources of the specified type.
          To grant access to only a specific resource, specify the
          `resource.id` property.

      userID:
        description: |
          A user ID.
          Specifies the user that the authorization is scoped to.

          When a user authenticates with username and password,
          InfluxDB generates a _user session_ with all the permissions
          specified by all the user's authorizations.
